    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ratatouille isn’t just a Disney movie—but you already knew that, right? If you know the movie, then, of course, you also know the luscious French Provençal dish that is that adorable little mouse’s namesake. The French have a way with vegetables and there may be no better example of that than ratatouille. This simple, silky stew of eggplant, tomato, zucchini flavored with onions and garlic—and always lots of good olive oil—is a delicately-seasoned celebration of summer’s most beloved vegetables. While ratatouille is delicious served all on its own—it’s classically rich with oil, so it’s a rib-sticking vegetarian dinner as-is—we’ve added sausage to the mix to take this sheet pan dinner recipe to new heights. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
        <li>Yellow Squash</li>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>Eggplant</li>
        <li>Cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Herbs! Fresh basil, fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Your favorite sausage. This can really be any sausage that you love! Turkey, chicken or pork sausage. You could even use a veggie sausage, like Beyond Meat or Field Roast. Just adjust the cook time if need be, according to the package directions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chopping. Lots and lots of it. But the good news is that once the zucchini, squash, eggplant and onions are sliced, the real work of this ratatouille recipe is done. </li>
        <li>Toss all of the vegetables with olive oil, salt, basil and thyme on that rimmed sheet pan. </li>
        <li>Nestle the sausages into the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Bake! Bake for 40 minutes, until the vegetables are meltingly tender and the sausages are cooked. </li>
        <li>Serve! We think this is particularly good served over creamy polenta, but you could just serve it as it is with a big salad and some crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
